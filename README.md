# Tsunami Alert


Tsunamis are a major hazard to visitors and residents in low-lying areas close to the ocean. Many seaside areas have tsunami alert sirens, but for visitors to beaches without sirens, a tsunami could become deadly. This app sets up a listener for tsunami events and distributes an SMS alert to participants to provide supplemental warning.
